# LearningTypeScript
Learning TypeScript.  I'm mainly using this repo to transfer things more easily between my work rig and home as I go through the TypeScript documentation and try to teach myself a thing or two.

All of the examples are coming from https://www.typescriptlang.org, who I am in no way affiliated with.
